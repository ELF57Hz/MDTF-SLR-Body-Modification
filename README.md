# MDTF-SLR-Body-Modification

Modification program for MD-mount SLR cameras using Nikon F-mount lenses

Modeling with SolidWorks 2022
Only tested by Seagull DF-400G, other MD-port SLRs need to be measured and sized.
The model is free to share, can be freely modified and distributed, it would be better if you can sign my name.
Only in a small range of test passed, unofficial stable modification program, please use at your own discretion. I am not responsible for any  damage to the camera or lens.

tips:

For Seagull DF-400G, replace the original mount screws with 4 x M2 x 6 Phillips flat head screws.

For most lightweight lenses, the strength of parts 3D printed with photosensitive resin is generally reliable, and parts obtained by 3D printing need to be further polished to adjust the size.
